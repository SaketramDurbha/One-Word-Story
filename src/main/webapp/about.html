      <h2>This is One Word Lifetime.</h2>
      <p>What is basically happening is a massive one-word story. Each user contributes words anonymously and it's added to the ongoing story. The story, after 50 chapters, becomes a book that anyone can read any time.</p>
      <h2>How do I submit?</h2>
      <p>It's pretty easy. Just type a word in the box at the bottom and hit enter or “add!” Be sure to follow the <a href='rules.html' target="_blank">rules</a>. Your word will be shown to the world and cannot be deleted, so be sure that the word you've submitted is what you actually want to submit.</p>
      <h2>How is punctuation placed?</h2>
      <p>Periods are placed after a random amount of words. Paragraphs are placed after a random amount of periods, and chapters are placed after a random amount of paragraphs! Books are always completed after 50 chapters, though. You can see how many of something is left by pressing the more button on the header.</p>
