### Back-end
  
Put your java crap in these folders:

   * src/main/java
  * FOR SERVLETS AND URL MAPPING
   * src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
  * FOR DATABASE MAPPING
   * src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml
   
### Front-end
  
Put your client-side crap in this folder (remember, folders mean a new part of the url, the webapp folder is /)
